## BTD Battles Tower Price Calculator

BTD Battles is a tower defense strategy game developed by Ninja Kiwi.

Have you ever wanted to quickly figure out the price of your defensive setup? Are you frustrated because the wiki contains outdated information? Well, this tool might help you.

### How to use

1. Clone/download the repository.
2. Run the app by typing `python towers.py` into your terminal in the root directory.

### Help! The prices are outdated!

You can change the prices by modifying the tower_prices_x.xx file. The file has the following format:

`tower name: base_cost 1/0 2/0 3/0 4/0 0/1 0/2 0/3 0/4`

If you do update the prices, please fork the repository and make a pull request. For more details on how to contribute, see the "How to Contribute" section.

### How to Contribute

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to the project! Note that since the program is very simplistic in nature, I may not accept contributions that fundamentally alter how the program is used. Updating tower prices when balance changes arrive would be especially helpful. Thank you.
